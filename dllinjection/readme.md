This is a sample C++ program that performs basic DLL injection.

This program takes as it's first argument the ID of the process
in which we wish to inject our dll, followed by the path to the
dll which we will be injecting. If no dll is specified, the sample 
dll 'test.dll' will be injected.

#TODO

1.) Test if this is even working
2.) Create a default DLL for injections.
